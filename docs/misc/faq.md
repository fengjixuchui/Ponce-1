# FAQ

**Why the name of Ponce?**

Juan Ponce de León \(1474 – July 1521\) was a Spanish explorer and conquistador. He discovered Florida in the United States. The IDA plugin will help you discover, explore and hopefully conquer the different paths in a binary.

**Can Ponce be used to analyze Windows, OSX and Linux binaries?**

Yes. Ponce is multi-platform and can be used in Windows, OSX and Linux.

**What platforms are supported?**
Ponce relies heavily on Triton, and support the same platforms Triton does: 
* x86
* x86-64
* Arm
* Arm64

**How many instructions per second can handle Ponce?**

In our tests we reach to process 3000 instructions per second. We plan to use the PIN tracer IDA offers to increase the speed.
